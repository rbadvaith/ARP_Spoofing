Conducted a network security analysis using ARP spoofing techniques to demonstrate vulnerabilities in network communication. Used tcpdump for packet capture, Ettercap for ARP poisoning attacks, and arpwatch for attack detection. Simulated a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack to capture credentials from a vulnerable website and implemented countermeasures to detect spoofing attempts. Successfully showcased the importance of security monitoring tools in preventing unauthorized access.
